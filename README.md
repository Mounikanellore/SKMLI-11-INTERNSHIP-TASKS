# SKMLI-11-INTERNSHIP-TASKS
1 A - Implementation of Decision Tree Algorithm Using M L Fundamentals
(program to demonstrate the working of the decision tree algorithm.)
ii) Back Propagation Algorithm Using M L Fundamentals.
(program for implementing the Back propagation algorithm and test the
same using appropriate datasets.)
1 B - Naïve Bayesian Classifier for Text Classification
(Assuming a set of documents that need to be classified, use the
naïve Bayesian classifier model to perform this task. Built-in Java classes/API
can be used to write the program. Calculate the accuracy, precision, and recall
for your dataset.)
T A S K 2 - Rapido Bike Ride Request Forecast using ML
(we will try to predict ride-request for a particular hour using machine
learning.)
T A S K 3 - Health disorder Predictor Using Machine Learning
(aims to implement a robust machine-learning model that can efficiently
predict the disease of a human, based on the symptoms that he/she possesses.)
